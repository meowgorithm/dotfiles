# Font family. You can also specify different fonts for the
# bold/italic/bold-italic variants. By default they are derived automatically,
# by the OSes font system. Setting them manually is useful for font families
# that have many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example:
# font_family Operator Mono Book
# bold_font Operator Mono Thick
# bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium
# or
# font_family SF Mono Medium
# bold_font        SF Mono Semibold
# bold_italic_font SF Mono Semibold
# Note that you should use the full family name but do not add Bold or Italic qualifiers
# to the name.

# Choose whether to use the system implementation of wcwidth() (used to

# Sending arbitrary text on shortcut key presses
# You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to
# the client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example:
# send_text all ctrl+alt+a Special text
# This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+a key combination.
# The text to be sent is a python string literal so you can use escapes like
# \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send unicode characters (or you can
# just input the unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument
# to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
# values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated combination of them.
# The special keyword all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
# the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty
# extended keyboard protocol. Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor
# to the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key):
# send_text normal ctrl+alt+a Word\x1b[H
# send_text application ctrl+alt+a Word\x1bOH

# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the
# specified unicode codepoints to a particular font. Useful if you need special
# rendering for some symbols, such as for Powerline. Avoids the need for
# patched fonts. Each unicode code point is specified in the form U+<code point
# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:
#
# symbol_map codepoints Font Family Name
#
# For example:
#
# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols
